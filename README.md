I started by creating a VPC and defining the IPv4 CIDR, which I set as 10.0.0.0/16. After I created six different subnets in two different availability zones. Three were in eu-north-1a and the other three were in eu-north-1b. Two of those subnets were Public, with CIDR of 10.0.0.0/24 - 10.0.1.0/24 and the other four subnets were private, with CIDR of 10.0.2.0/24 - 10.0.5.0/24.

I then attached an Internet Gateway to the VPC to give it access to the Internet. After I created a Public Route Table to connect the public subnets to the internet. I also created two different Private Route Tables for the private subnets in the different availability zones, so that traffic can be routed accordingly. Then I created two NAT Gateways and attached those to the two public subnets and routed them to give restricted internet access to the private subnets.

Then I started making the security groups for the different resources that will be used in those subnets. I started by creating an Auto Load Balancer Security Group, which allowed traffic from ports 80 and 443 from anywhere. Then I created an SSH Security Group, which would be used for SSHing into the VPC and it only allows traffic from port 22 and my IP Address. After I created a Webserver Security Group, which would allow traffic from ports 80, 443, and 22 and the IP addresses from ALB and SSH Security Groups. I made another security group for Database Security Group, which allowed traffic from port 3306 and IP addresses from the Webserver Security Group. The last security group I made was the EFS Security Group, which allowed traffic from ports 2049, and 22, and IP addresses from the webserver and SSH Security Group. All these security groups are made for the specific resources to control the inbound traffic and only allow desired to access the resources, to make sure there are no security incidents.

After I created two different EC2 instances, one in two of the private subnets in two different availability zones. I attached the relevant security groups so that only the desired traffic can access the instance. I also made sure not to give them public IP addresses to again make sure no unauthorised access is made. Also created new key pairs to add an extra layer of security.


Then I had to make a Bastion Host instance to be able to connect to the webservers, since they don't have public IP addresses you have to use Bastion Host to be able to access the webserver and set up everything. The bastion host was set up in the Pub Subnet with the relevant security group so it could make SSH connections. After SSHing into the bastion host, I needed to connect to the web server, for that I had to get the kep pair for the webserver into the bastion host and SSH from the bastion host into the web server, this would work since both are in the VPC and same IP range, this is another security measurement and layer, which would not allow any unauthorised access to the web server and gain access to the source code.

I moved on to creating an RDS (Relational Database Service) instance with the MYSQL engine. I auto-generated the password for the database to make sure it wasn't easy to guess for anyone. During the setup, I applied the relevant security group again to control the incoming and outgoing traffic for the RDS and added it to the relevant VPC and the subnets. After I finished setting up the RDS, I attached it to Wordpress on the webserver.

Then I proceeded to create an EFS (Elastic File System). After creating I had to assign mount targets so the EFS is in the two private subnets and assign the relevant security groups. After the setup, I had to
